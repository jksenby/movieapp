# MovieApp

This is simple React application with Movie API, that i created in 24 hours. It was kind of challange for me, create fully functioning website in one day. There it no absolutly any layout, because i was concentrating on functionality, so i just used react-bootstrap for everything.

I tried add this app on Github Pages, but i didn't successed, but if it will be working in the future, here is the link: https://jksenby.github.io/movieapp
